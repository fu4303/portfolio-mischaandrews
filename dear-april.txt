Dear April,

I hope this little package arrives safely and finds you well!

We haven't met before but I'm an old friend of Adam's. We used to work together at the dinosaur museum. I quickly became a fan of the art he'd draw while at the front counter waiting for customers, and now I sometimes commission him to bring some of my half-baked ideas to life. Today I work as a web editor and live in Stockholm, Sweden with my partner John and our little dog Meatwad.

I've heard that you were diagnosed with cancer and are (or were?) undergoing chemotherapy. I have no idea of what that's like both physically and emotionally, but feel safe in guessing that it sucks.

A few years ago I had my gallbladder removed, and the lead-up and recovery period left me feeling vulnerable. But, and I hope this is also the case for you, it also filled me with happiness to realise what I do have. This is why I wanted to send you this little care package. Even though we've never met I know you deserve happiness, and perhaps you don't need this package to feel that, but hopefully you'll enjoy it nonetheless.

In August I'll be travelling to Iceland for the first time. I've heard you're a fan of the country! I'm not so great as a photographer but I'd be very happy to share my photos and stories if you like.

All the best,
Mischa

PS. Assuming the package arrives safely, it contains:
1. A scented candle (cotton / orchid)
2. Hand and body lotion (silky green tea with almond oil)
These two are from a homewares store called Lagerhaus, which I'm pretty sure is one of the inspirations for kikki.K.
3. Marabou Oreo bar
Marabou is the best-known chocolate brand here, and they come in all kinds of flavours.
4. Plopp chocolate bar
I found plopp hilarious when I first moved here, but now they're just another kind of chocolate. Still yummy, though!

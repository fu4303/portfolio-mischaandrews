<p>Dear April,</p>

<p>I hope this little package arrives safely and finds you well!</p>

<p>We haven't met before but I'm an old friend of Adam's. We used to work together at the dinosaur museum. I quickly became a fan of the art he'd draw while at the front counter waiting for customers, and now I sometimes commission him to bring some of my half-baked ideas to life. Today I work as a web editor and live in Stockholm, Sweden with my partner John and our little dog Meatwad.</p>

<p>I've heard that you were diagnosed with cancer and are (or were?) undergoing chemotherapy. I have no idea of what that's like both physically and emotionally, but feel safe in guessing that it sucks.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had my gallbladder removed, and the lead-up and recovery period left me feeling vulnerable. But, and I hope this is also the case for you, it also filled me with happiness to realise what I do have. This is why I wanted to send you this little care package. Even though we've never met I know you deserve happiness, and perhaps you don't need this package to feel that, but hopefully you'll enjoy it nonetheless.</p>

<p>In August I'll be travelling to Iceland for the first time. I've heard you're a fan of the country! I'm not so great as a photographer but I'd be very happy to share my photos and stories if you like.</p>

<p>All the best,<br/>
Mischa</p>

<p>PS. Assuming the package arrives safely, it contains:</p>

<ol><li>A scented candle (cotton / orchid)</li>
<li>Hand and body lotion (silky green tea with almond oil)</li>
These two are from a homewares store called Lagerhaus, which I'm pretty sure is one of the inspirations for kikki.K.
<li>Marabou Oreo bar</li>
Marabou is the best-known chocolate brand here, and they come in all kinds of flavours.
<li>Plopp chocolate bar</li>
I found plopp hilarious when I first moved here, but now they're just another kind of chocolate. Still yummy, though!
